Tailormade Confluence Macros and Addons

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of Confluence add-ons and macros using the Atlassian Forge CLI. Atlassian Forge is a development platform and suite of tools enabling developers to create secure cloud apps for Atlassian products like Jira and Confluence. Using the Forge CLI (Command Line Interface), developers can easily build, test, and deploy add-ons and macros.

### What are Confluence Add-ons and Macros?

- **Confluence Add-ons:** These are extensions or plugins that add additional functionalities to Confluence. They can range from simple UI tweaks to complex integrations with external services.

- **Confluence Macros:** Macros are special functions in Confluence that allow the insertion of custom content like charts, tables, or specific formats. Macros can be part of add-ons and offer a flexible way to integrate content into Confluence pages.

## Macro Ideas

1. **Blog Aggregator Macro:** A macro that aggregates various blogs and displays them in a formatted list within a Confluence page. Ideal for teams wanting to keep track of industry-related news and updates.

2. **Event Calendar Macro:** An interactive macro that displays upcoming events or meetings in a user-friendly calendar format. Useful for planning and overviewing team events.

3. **Birthday Calendar Macro:** A simple macro that displays team members' birthdays. Promotes a sense of community in the team by highlighting personal occasions.
